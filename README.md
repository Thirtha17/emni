# ThirdEye: Your AI-Powered Sentinel

### Motivation

Our journey with ThirdEye started from a collective vision to redefine security measures in personal and professional spaces. The unsettling rise in security breaches fueled our determination to integrate advanced AI capabilities into everyday safety protocols, ensuring peace of mind through innovative technology.

### Tools Used
- **Android App Development**: We adopted Kotlin to develop a user-friendly interface, empowering users to manage settings, view camera feeds, and receive instant alerts.
- **Facial Recognition Integration**: Utilizing Google ML Kit and OpenCV, ThirdEye recognizes known individuals and alerts about unfamiliar faces, ensuring a personalized security experience.
- **Real-time Data Management**: Leveraging Firebase Firestore for data storage and Firebase Cloud Messaging for instant notifications, our system maintains a vigilant watch over your spaces.
- **Motion Detection Capability**: By integrating IoT-based motion sensors, ThirdEye extends its surveillance to detect and alert users about unauthorized movements, enhancing overall security measures.

### Features
- **Multiple Camera Integration**: Add and manage multiple cameras through a user-friendly mobile application.
- **Facial Recognition**: Utilize advanced facial recognition algorithms to identify family, friends, and employees.
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Monitor live feeds from all connected cameras through the mobile app.
- **Event Logging**: Record timestamps and individuals recognized by the system, storing data securely on Firebase database.
- **Alert System**: Receive instant notifications via email and push notifications on the app when an unknown individual is detected.
- **Emergency Response**: Activate an emergency alert system that triggers a buzzer and provides options to call emergency numbers.
- **Model Training**: Train the facial recognition model by feeding images of family and friends to improve accuracy.
- **Emergency Location Sharing**: Within the app, a dedicated button enables users to send their current location via email instantly, ensuring help is always a tap away during critical situations.
- **Direct 911 Access**: A unique, externally accessible button allows users to call 911 directly from the app interface, facilitating immediate emergency response without navigating through multiple screens.
